# socialInterest — agent guide

Interest-centred media sharing app. **Spec-driven**: no code exists yet; the design is
complete and authoritative. Built with [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).

Read before doing anything substantive:

| File | What it settles |
|---|---|
| `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | **Binding rules.** v1.0.0, 5 principles, 2 NON-NEGOTIABLE |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/spec.md` | 49 FRs, 12 SCs, 6 user stories |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/plan.md` | Stack, structure, cost posture |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/research.md` | 9 decisions (D1–D9) **with the alternatives already weighed** |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/data-model.md` | DynamoDB single-table design, 20 access patterns |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/contracts/` | OpenAPI + the visibility matrix contract |
| `specs/001-interest-media-sharing/tasks.md` | 172 tasks, T001–T172, ordered |

Do not re-litigate a decision in `research.md` without reading why it was made. Several
look arbitrary and are not — see "Decisions that look wrong but aren't" below.

## Hard rules

**Cost — the owner's standing instruction.** No task may provision billable cloud
resources without explicit, specific approval. Approval for one deploy is not approval
for the next. Everything runs on the `local` profile: DynamoDB Local, MinIO, ffmpeg, a
local JWT issuer, all in Docker, no AWS account. IaC may be written and `cdk synth`'d
(free, no credentials); **applying it is never an implicit part of a task.**

**AWS was dropped as the deployment target on 2026-09-05.** The four `aws` adapters
(S3, MediaConvert, Cognito, CloudFront) had never been executed once, so they were
deleted rather than left behind a profile switch — four untested implementations
selected by an env var is how a defect hides. There is now **one implementation per
port**, and it is the one every test exercises. `RUNTIME_PROFILE` accepts `local`
only and says so if given anything else.

The ports stay. They keep the media pipeline and identity check out of the modules
that use them, and they are where a second implementation would go. **If one is ever
added, Principle V applies again**: register the divergence and verify the production
path before release. Deleting the adapters removed an instance, not the rule.

Consequence worth naming: there is no production hosting story now. DynamoDB Local
is a dev tool, not a production datastore, and `infra/` still describes an AWS stack
that nothing targets. Both are open questions, not settled ones.

**Constitution, in brief** (read the file for the binding text):

1. *Interest Is the Organising Principle* (NON-NEGOTIABLE) — a person-follow must never
   widen a feed beyond followed interests (FR-033).
2. *Visibility Is Decided Once* (NON-NEGOTIABLE) — one `VisibilityFilter`; every read
   path goes through it; every surface enumerated in the matrix contract.
3. *Privacy Guarantees Are Enforced Server-Side* — and tested via the path a hostile
   client would take, not the well-behaved one.
4. *Safety Ships With the Product* — reporting/blocking/moderation is a release gate,
   not polish. US1–US6 alone must not ship publicly.
5. *Emulation Is Not Evidence* — a green local suite against a different implementation
   is not proof the production path works.

## Decisions that look wrong but aren't

- **Read-time feed assembly, not fan-out-on-write** (D1). Forced by FR-017 + SC-009: a
  visibility flip must land everywhere immediately, which materialised timelines cannot
  guarantee. Do not "optimise" this into precomputed timelines.
  **Measured 2026-09-05, attributed (spec 002 R1)**: the ceiling is
  **DynamoDB Local**, not the design. `bench:ceiling` measured the three limits
  apart — generator 187,439 req/s, **emulator 827 req/s**, application shape with
  a stubbed datastore 5,574 req/s. `bench:feed-load`, now driven over HTTP, shows
  throughput **flat at 6-7 req/s** across concurrency 1→100 while p95 rises
  368ms→6,463ms: a saturated dependency, not an algorithm out of headroom.
  At rest the feed is comfortable — p50 183ms at the 200-follow cap over 100k
  posts. **001's p95 11.8s figure measured the emulator and must not be cited as
  evidence about D1**; neither may this run. `002/SC-002` (10,000 concurrent) is
  **unverified** and only a provisioned-DynamoDB run can close it — gated on the
  owner's approval. The D1 hybrid is **not warranted on this evidence**; if a
  later run does implicate the design, the hybrid holds candidate references with
  `VisibilityFilter` still at read time — **not** fan-out-on-write, which FR-017
  and SC-009 still forbid.
- **`VisibilityFilter` is a top-level module, not a helper in `posts/`** (D6). Six
  hand-written predicates is six silent leaks. Never inline a visibility check.
- **DynamoDB has no adapter; every other managed service does** (D9). DynamoDB Local
  speaks the same API, so no abstraction is warranted. Don't add one.
- **PostgreSQL is genuinely the better fit for this spec** (D3) and was not chosen —
  DynamoDB is the owner's instruction. The friction (fuzzy interest search, merges,
  aggregation) is deliberately concentrated behind `CatalogueSearch` and one async job.
- **Interest search uses an in-memory catalogue cache, not OpenSearch** (D3). The
  catalogue is small and slow-changing. OpenSearch replaces it behind the same interface
  when post-content search arrives.

## Environment: cloud sandbox (Claude Code on the web)

Docker **works** here, but two setup steps are needed and **neither survives a container
reset**:

```bash
# 1. Mirror first — Docker Hub's blob CDN is blocked by egress policy
mkdir -p /etc/docker
echo '{ "registry-mirrors": ["https://mirror.gcr.io"] }' > /etc/docker/daemon.json

# 2. Start the daemon detached. A bare `dockerd &` is reaped with its parent shell
#    and every later command then sees a dead socket.
setsid nohup dockerd > /var/log/dockerd.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
```

Verified working: `docker compose` with DynamoDB Local + MinIO, presigned S3 upload,
`TransactWriteItems`, and ffmpeg producing H.264 + poster frame + HLS.

**Two limits nothing fixes**: no public inbound route (a React Native client on a phone
or simulator cannot reach an API running here), and the container is ephemeral. Build and
test the backend here; do not try to host one.

### Known dead ends — already tried, don't repeat

| Attempt | Result |
|---|---|
| `dynalite` (pure-JS DynamoDB) | **No `TransactWriteItems`** — the exact op FR-017 needs. Unusable. |
| DynamoDB Local from `d1ni2b6xgvw0s0.cloudfront.net` | 403, egress policy. Use `s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dynamodb-local/dynamodb_local_latest.tar.gz` |
| `apt-get install ffmpeg` | Fails, Debian repos blocked. Use the `linuxserver/ffmpeg` container |
| MinIO binary from `dl.min.io` | 403. Use the `minio/minio` image |
| `quay.io` | Unreachable. `public.ecr.aws`, `ghcr.io`, `mirror.gcr.io` all work |

## Spec-kit workflow

Order: `constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement`.

**Skills are hyphenated, not dotted.** The upstream docs say `/speckit.specify`; the
Claude Code integration installs `/speckit-specify` (skill names can't contain dots).
Typing the dotted form finds nothing.

After a spec-kit command changes an artifact, re-check the others for drift — `plan.md`'s
Constitution Check in particular goes stale when the constitution changes.

## What spec 002 established (2026-09-05)

Feature 001 was complete and green and the product did not work. Five defects,
none visible to any test that existed, all found the moment `apps/e2e` drove the
app's own data layer over HTTP against a running API:

**Deferred, not met** (decision 2026-09-05): `002/SC-002` (10,000 concurrent) and the
five real-usage criteria. Both need spend; neither is evidence of a defect. Report
them as *unverified* and *unmeasured*, never as met.

1. **The contract and the API disagreed about publishing.** OpenAPI said
   `uploadIds: string[]`; the server wanted `uploads: [{uploadId, key, kind}]`.
   Any client generated from the contract 400s on every publish.
2. **The server trusted a client-supplied media key**, so a post could point at
   another person's media. Uploads are now persisted and the server derives key
   and kind from its own record.
3. **`ApiClient` sent no token on optional-auth endpoints**, so a signed-in
   person was anonymous on `GET /posts/{id}` and was told "not available to you"
   about their own post.
4. **Nothing subscribed to `post.created`.** A published post stayed `pending`
   forever, and a pending post is visible only to its author — so nobody could
   ever see anyone else's post. 001's suites hid it by calling `reconcile()` by
   hand. `MediaDispatchService` fixes it; `MEDIA_DISPATCH_ON_CREATE=false` in the
   integration harness, which drives states deterministically.
5. **`interestFollowCount` was never incremented** — every profile said 0.

The lesson worth keeping: **both sides generated from one document agree with
each other by construction.** Contract tests and a generated client cannot catch
any of the above. Only a request can. `pnpm --filter @sih/e2e test` is that
request; do not let it become a suite that drives the generated client instead of
`apps/mobile/src/data`.

Two more of the same shape, found earlier in the same session: `pnpm lint`
resolved to a global eslint binary and had never actually run, and an
integration test passed on timing luck because its uniqueness suffix was
near-duplicate by construction.

**Run the real CI step list before pushing**, not a proxy for it. Two red builds
came from checking typecheck/lint/tests and assuming that covered CI.

## If you are asked to parallelise the build

Measured from `tasks.md`, not guessed:

- **`apps/api` holds 119 of 172 tasks.** Phases 1–2 (T001–T048) are a serial foundation.
  This project does **not** decompose into wide independent threads, and multi-agent work
  costs roughly 15× the tokens. Parallelise Waves 2–3 only.
- **T044–T048 (the visibility choke point) gate everything.** No read path may be written
  before the filter exists.
- **Single-owner files** — two agents editing these will overwrite each other:

  | File | Tasks | Phases |
  |---|---|---|
  | `apps/api/tests/visibility/matrix.spec.ts` | 6 | 2,3,4,5,7,9 |
  | `interests/interest.controller.ts` | 5 | 4,5 |
  | `posts/post.controller.ts` | 4 | 3,8 |
  | `posts/post.service.ts` | 3 | 3,8 |
  | `feed/feed.service.ts` | 2 | 5,6 |

- **US4 depends on US3** — the only genuine cross-story dependency (FR-033 needs the
  interest-follow feed to exist first). Same agent, sequential.
- **Single-owner files for spec 002** — same rule, different set:

  | File | Why |
  |---|---|
  | `apps/e2e/support/client.ts` | The one place the journeys bind to the mobile data layer |
  | `apps/api/bench/harness.ts` | Shared by both benches |
  | `apps/mobile/src/screens/index.tsx` | Every container lives here |
  | `docs/verification/divergence-register.md` | `verify:register` checks it; two writers will disagree |
  | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Every phase wants to add a step |

- Lanes that are genuinely independent after Phase 2: `apps/api`, `apps/mobile`
  (once T018 generates the client), `apps/workers`, `infra`.
- Sizing per Anthropic's guidance: **3–5 agents, 5–6 tasks each**, `isolation: "worktree"`.
- Agent Teams needs an interactive session and a terminal agent panel — **not usable in
  the cloud web environment**. Use subagents or the Workflow tool here.
- Guard stalls with the `TeammateIdle` hook (exit 2 keeps a teammate working) and
  `TaskCompleted` (exit 2 blocks a bogus completion). Documented failure modes: task
  status lagging, and agents stopping early on errors instead of recovering.

## Conventions

- Branch: `claude/spec-kit-integration-juhrza`. Commit and push; nothing else persists.
- `.specify/feature.json` is gitignored machine-local state — do not commit it.
- Never Read a subagent's `.output` file: it symlinks the full transcript and will
  overflow context.
