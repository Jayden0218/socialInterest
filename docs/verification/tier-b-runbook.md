# Tier B — core journeys on a physical device

**This cannot be run in the cloud sandbox.** There is no public inbound route, so a
phone or simulator cannot reach an API hosted there. It is a property of the
environment, not a setup problem. Run this on a developer machine.

Tier A (`pnpm --filter @sih/e2e test`) already drives the app's data layer over
real HTTP on every change. Tier B exists for what only hardware exercises:
permissions prompts, the camera and photo library, real network conditions,
background suspension, and the rendered UI itself.

## Setup

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm --filter @sih/infra db:create-local
pnpm --filter @sih/infra s3:create-local
pnpm --filter @sih/infra seed:catalogue
pnpm --filter @sih/api dev                       # binds 0.0.0.0:3000

# The device must reach your machine, so use its LAN address, not localhost.
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<your-lan-ip>:3000/v1 pnpm --filter @sih/mobile start
```

Open the dev build on one iOS and one Android device on the same network.

## What to walk

Every journey in `specs/002-production-readiness/contracts/e2e-journeys.md`:
J-01 to J-10, then N-01 to N-04 where a device can express them.

Pay attention to the things Tier A cannot see:

- the photo-library and camera permission prompts, including **refusing** them
- publishing a video shot on the device, not a fixture
- backgrounding the app mid-upload and returning
- a slow or dropped connection during publish - the retry path (FR-008) should
  not require re-selecting the media
- whether a failed load renders its error rather than an empty state

## Recording the result

Copy `runs/TEMPLATE-journey-run.md` to `runs/<date>-tier-b-<platform>.md`, fill in
the device and the commit, and mark every journey pass, fail, or **not run**.
Never leave a row blank, and never record a simulator pass as tier B - the
permissions and hardware paths are the entire reason this tier exists.
