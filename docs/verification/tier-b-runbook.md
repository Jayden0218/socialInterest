# Tier B — core journeys on a physical device

**This does not run in the cloud sandbox as configured** — but the reason is narrower
than first recorded here, and worth knowing.

Nothing connects *in* to the sandbox directly. A reverse tunnel is an *outbound*
connection though, and `cloudflared` runs there fine; it fails only because
`api.trycloudflare.com` is outside the environment's network allowlist. Raising the
environment to `Custom` network access with the tunnel hosts allowed would let a phone
on any network reach an API running in the sandbox.

Two easier routes exist, and either is preferable:

- **`claude --teleport <session-id>`** pulls the session onto your own machine, where the
  device already is. No tunnel, no configuration.
- **Same LAN**, as below.

Whichever route, the pass itself must happen on real hardware.

Tier A (`pnpm --filter @sih/e2e test`) already drives the app's data layer over
real HTTP on every change. Tier B exists for what only hardware exercises:
permissions prompts, the camera and photo library, real network conditions,
background suspension, and the rendered UI itself.

## Setup

```bash
docker compose up -d
pnpm --filter @sih/infra db:create-local
pnpm --filter @sih/infra s3:create-local
pnpm --filter @sih/infra seed:catalogue
pnpm --filter @sih/api dev                       # binds 0.0.0.0:3000

# The device must reach your machine, so use its LAN address, not localhost.
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<your-lan-ip>:3000/v1 pnpm --filter @sih/mobile start
```

Open the dev build on one iOS and one Android device on the same network.

## What to walk

Every journey in `specs/002-production-readiness/contracts/e2e-journeys.md`:
J-01 to J-10, then N-01 to N-04 where a device can express them.

Pay attention to the things Tier A cannot see:

- the photo-library and camera permission prompts, including **refusing** them
- publishing a video shot on the device, not a fixture
- backgrounding the app mid-upload and returning
- a slow or dropped connection during publish - the retry path (FR-008) should
  not require re-selecting the media
- whether a failed load renders its error rather than an empty state

## Recording the result

Copy `runs/TEMPLATE-journey-run.md` to `runs/<date>-tier-b-<platform>.md`, fill in
the device and the commit, and mark every journey pass, fail, or **not run**.
Never leave a row blank, and never record a simulator pass as tier B - the
permissions and hardware paths are the entire reason this tier exists.
